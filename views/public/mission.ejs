        <h2>Why Ella Rises Exists</h2>
        <p>Ella Rises was founded to address the underrepresentation of women, particularly from diverse backgrounds, in STEAM fields. We believe that every young woman deserves the opportunity to explore her potential in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics.</p>
        <p>Through our partnerships with Utah Valley University and Brigham Young University, we provide access to cutting-edge resources, expert mentors, and hands-on learning experiences that inspire confidence and spark curiosity.</p>
        <p>Our programs celebrate cultural heritage while building the technical skills needed to succeed in the 21st century workforce. We believe that embracing one's identity is a source of strength and innovation.</p>
